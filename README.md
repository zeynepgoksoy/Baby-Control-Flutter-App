# What we do in this app?
Main purpose of this app to create a bridge between patients that have newborn babies and doctors.
This is the app for people who newly become parents. Newborn babies have routine controls every month and have to be vaccinated at spesific times. With this app parents add as record to app. After you adding your baby then you can add his/her informations and after every month you can add the baby's new control records. 
Doctors can view their baby patient's informations and control results.

## Getting Started
